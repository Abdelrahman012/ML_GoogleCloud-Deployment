# Seul Bike Rental Prediction

- **Dataset of Bike share** • predict the required number of bikes for rental given information about the weather and time of the day** 
- The dataset provided is obtained from UC 
    Irvine Machine Learning Repository - Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset

#### Introduction about this project:

>In this project,  an **Bike share dataset** ,contains 31 columns ids  (you can find the file data/train.csv), was provided and required to use **ML** Model Model to predict the seul bike rental.  
 
> **These **steps** were followed in getting app done:**
- [x] Get the data from **Kaggle**.
- You could check this step in `..//preprocessing` folder
- [x] Do some **preprocessing** on the columns by changing data types and creating new features.
- You could check this step in `../preprocessing/preprocessing.ipynb
- [x] **Training** train ML Model (Grdaient Bosting and Random Forest) 
<span style="color:red">NOTE:
•  ML Flow is used to determine the best model
 </span>.
- You can check this step in `..//trainingmodel/training_ml.ipynb`.

- [x] Deployment of ML using **Flask**.
